# Building:
- To support clipboard stuff (unstable) you need to add "--cfg=web_sys_unstable_apis" to the RUSTFLAGS environment variable
    - set RUSTFLAGS=--cfg=web_sys_unstable_apis
    - So far I haven't found a way of doing this automatically

# Features:
- WebGL2 (GLSL 300)
- Egui for UI
- wasm-pack and wasm-bindgen for Rust to Wasm 

# Conventions
- UV(0, 0) is on top left
- Right-handed, Z-up
- NDC space: Left-handed, X right, Y up, Z into the screen, (-1, -1, -1) on bottom left close, (1, 1, 1) on top right far

# Documentation
## Asset manifest 
The `build.rs` script will scan the contents of the `/public` folder and generate an `autogenerated_manifest.rs` file in the output directory. It's not meant to be interacted with, but when loading our `asset_manifest.rs` uses the entries in that file to build a map of all the assets that can we can potentially fetch.

Later on during execution, if `file.glb` is requested, the scene is not loaded yet but the file is on the manifest we can try fetching it.
